Organize Files Script
Description
Welcome to the organize.py script! This Python script helps you keep your folders tidy by organizing files into categorized directories. The script automatically moves files based on their extensions into appropriate folders, such as Images, Codes, Videos, Docs, Archives, and Apps. After moving the files, the original files are deleted from their initial locations.

How It Works
Images: Files with extensions .png, .jpg, .jpeg, and .gif are moved to the Images folder.
Code Files: Files with extensions .py, .css, .html, and .bash are moved to the Codes folder.
Videos: Files with extensions .mp4 and .wben are moved to the Videos folder.
Documents: Files with extensions .pdf and .word are moved to the Docs folder.
Archives: Files with extensions .zip, .rar, and .tar are moved to the Archives folder.
Applications: Files with extensions .dmg and .exe are moved to the Apps folder.
